Subject:	******** Operational Storage Purchases

****,

In ******* we had a plan to purchase 0.5 Bcf of gas that was projected to bring our operational storage level to 12 Bcf by ******************** and were concerned about over-filling our storage fields from potential long gas by shippers.  In reality, prices have risen and shippers have shorted the system by 1.7 Bcf *************.  Our original plan, based on a combination of physical requirements and regulatory strategy was as follows:

Ending ******* Balance		12 Bcf
Ending ******** Balance		13 Bcf
Ending ******** Balance		14 Bcf

To acheive this plan we are projecting a purchase in ******** of at least 2.5 Bcf (depending upon shipper short gas over the remainder of *********).  We also expect to receive 0.3 Bcf of SBA imbalance payback in ******** that should raise the operational storage levels to approximately 13 Bcf.  We are still at risk for over-filling our storage fields in ******** and do not wish to buy any volumes that might push us over the 13 Bcf operational storage level.  Therefore, we are targeting the purchase of 2.5 Bcf of gas (which may be adjusted based on the customer's imbalances over *************) for ********.

***************
